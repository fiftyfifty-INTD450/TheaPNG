Thea,

Below I’ve attached something that I think you should take a look at. I’ve been looking up abusive behaviors, and I can’t help but feel like you treat me like this all the time. You are always looking at ways to humiliate me and put me down about myself. You treat me so badly that I’m worried to even bring you around my family in case they see how bad of a choice I’ve made out of my life. Do you just use me for your sexual pleasures? Sometimes it feels like it. 

I do so much good for you, and this is what I get in response. You just manipulate me for money, but guess what? You’re not getting another cent out of me until you treat me better because that is WHAT I DESERVE, YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT. You better show me the decent respect of a human being. I don’t know who raised you, but it is unacceptable.

I love you so much, and I just want to see that you love me too. 

Signs of an abusive relationship
Does your partner:
	- humiliate or yell at you?
	- criticize you and put you down?
	- treat you so badly that you’re embarrassed for your friends or family to see?
	- ignore or put down your opinions or accomplishments?
	- blame you for their own abusive behavior?
	- see you as property or a sex object, rather than as a person?
