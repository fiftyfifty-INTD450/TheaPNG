ECON 104 Performance
October 4, 2003
Dr. Joseph Mikami

Hi Thea,

I am emailing you to inform you that the first midterms for ECON 104 have been graded. Unfortunately, your mark has come back at 34%. Considering the course consists of a midterm and final, it will be difficult to raise your mark above the required 50% in order to pass.

However, there is still time for you to bring your grade up and pass. If you would like, I can send some university resources your way that may help with school performance. I understand that the first year transition into a university workload can be stressful. 

I am also available during office hours if you have questions about the course material. 

Best regards,

Joseph
