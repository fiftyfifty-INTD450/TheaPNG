Hello Thea,

Let me begin by saying that I was very impressed by your audition last week. I think that you were very passionate about your music and your ambition to work as a sessional instructor for kids! 

Unfortunately, we need our instructors to be proficient and confident on the piano in order to be able to effectively teach our younger students. I admire your passion for this position, but the perfect candidate needs to have a strong sense of confidence and leadership in order to teach our younger students and guide them through the learning process.

Nevertheless, I would encourage you to apply again in a couple of months, improving your skills in the meantime, and come back with a new, reinvigorated attitude! I have faith that you can do it!

Sincerely,

Julia Stevens
