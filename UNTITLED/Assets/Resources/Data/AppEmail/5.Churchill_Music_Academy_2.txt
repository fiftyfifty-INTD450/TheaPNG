I guess my complaining does have some support to it. Looks like the pianist dream isn’t working out and it’s not going to take you anywhere in life. You need to start focusing on getting a real job to support us. You can’t expect to just pay for everything for you with nothing in return. I can only make so much money in order to put food on the table for us. It’s about time that you start getting realistic.
