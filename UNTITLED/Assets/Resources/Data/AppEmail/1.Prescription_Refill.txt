Kensington Prescription Centre Prescription Refill

Dr. Angela Podruchny

Hello Thea,

I have refilled your Trexall prescription and it should be available for you from the pharmacy in the next few days. Your condition hasnâ€™t changed substantially since your last appointment, but it is always recommend to make yearly appointments as your dexterity will deteriorate over time. 

As always, if you have any questions, feel free to make an appointment or contact me over phone or email!

Best regards,

Dr. Angela Podruchny
