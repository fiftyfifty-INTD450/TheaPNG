Thea,

We appreciate your application working as a part-time piano player at the East End, but the fact of the matter is we just can’t take you on. You were good in your audition, but not nearly good enough to handle the stage solo. You just don’t have nearly enough playing experience, and we’re looking for experienced players who can play great music consistently. Your arthritis is also a serious issue, as I need to be able to depend on you to perform every night without any concerns. Unfortunately, we’re going to have to reject your application for the part-time piano job.  

If you’re still interested, we are also hiring right now for servers if you want to continue to work at the East End?

Regards,


Marcin Stefanyk
