You see why I keep bitching to you about your dumbass music? It’s total garbage, and it’s not going to take you anywhere in life. You need to start focusing on getting a real job to support us. Your waiter job is not paying much, and I can only make so much goddamn money to put food on the table. Drop the fucking music fantasy.
