Hello Thea,

My name is Henry, and I believe we spoke last week at the university job fair! I was very impressed by your interest in working at Hatton-McFarland and I would highly encourage you to apply online to our HR team!

careers@hattonmcfarland.com

Even though you’re still in school now, there are lots of opportunities for internships and summer jobs. We’re still a small team, but I think that you would do very well at Hatton-McFarland. I hope to see you with us in the near future!

Best regards,


Henry McFarland
